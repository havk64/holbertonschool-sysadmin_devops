1. I need to create an authentication ssh key pair with both, public and private keys using the ssh-keygen unix command with some parameters like -t to specify the type(algorithm) of the keys and -b to specify the key length in bits.
2. We need to copy our public key to the server that will use SSH key authentication so the server can recognize its unique signature. 
3. The private key needs to be keept secure and can never shared! When requested its passphrase must be entered in order to decrypt it.The passphrase is never transmitted over the network. Instead it is used to decrypt the private key in local system.
